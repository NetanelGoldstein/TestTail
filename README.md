# TestTail
This is the files for a UNITY 2d game. The goal is for a knight to destroy a radioactive fox. It was created as a semester project at Frostburg State University by myself and three classmates. I was one of two main coders, as can be seen from the contributions.
The code (C#) is located in /TestTail/Test/Assets/Scripts
